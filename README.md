# dashboard-streamlit

Was having problems uploading it to azure as it would consitently give me a continous loading screen 
Tried using GCP first but was having trouble upgrading python to a higher version
uploaded photos to show protcols that i had in azure and what was poping up on my end
I used my local machine to run the streamlit
