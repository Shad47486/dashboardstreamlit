UFT also provides us with PTO, we only work 180 days a year, which is not the case for private school SLPs, and contracted fee-for-service SLPs. Mental health with a Union to back us up is much more high quality. ","Our Union (UFT) offers free mental health counseling through UFT MAP. Non union union workplaces did not offer that. On the contrary, they drove us crazy, to the point of quitting.","I (previously), not now, had an abusive administrator, in the NYCDOE, at a Bronx school. Despite us being unionized, bad administration is plentiful. Even if you’re the best SLP, most inspiring and most empathetic, most pro-active, if Admin doesn’t like you, they can still find ways to target you for termination. The UFT can help, but only so much. This can also be a factor in mental well-being: whether or not you have a good boss. This is a question that this survey should ask: “Do you have a good, fair boss?” It makes a big difference in mental health among SLPs."

Following the loss of my father, I found that I NEEDED to speak with someone about how overwhelmed I was feeling.  My job as an SLP in the schools doesn't leave much room for self-care.  At times, I suffer from burnout because I work as many hours outside of the school week as I do during the week.  Administrators only seem to care about our ability to provide direct service to students and do not acknowledge the legitimate need for SLPs to have time allotted in their school day to manage caseload responsibilities and plan lessons.  ",,"As SLPs in the schools, we are paid according to the teachers' salary scale; however, SLPs often fall into many gray areas and are not treated equitably.  We don't get an extra 45 minute prep per week like classroom teachers do (for planning), our caseloads are not capped at 25, we are expected to complete Medicaid log notes on our own time; yet, we are expected to pay for CEUs to maintain our licensure.   The inequities are numerous.  Teachers are provided with substitute coverage so that they can test their students' reading levels.  We are provided with a 1 hour testing slot for re-evaluation testing per week.  This is not nearly enough time to test a student for his/her re-eval, so we often pull students during our lunch or prep.  Teachers routinely attend various trainings/meetings where they are away from their class.  We don't even have dept. meetings during the school day because we are not supposed to cancel students' sessions.  It's very frustrating to feel like we're the underdog and no one really cares about fairness and how it impacts our mental health."
